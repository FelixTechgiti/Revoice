# --no-default-features drops the rodio backend and with it cpal, alsa-sys and
# every other system library. What is LEFT is what this device needs:
#
#   * the pipe backend, which is compiled in unconditionally — PCM to stdout,
#     no ALSA in librespot at all. The device already owns the speaker, and
#     two things opening it is the #80 failure: a blocking open with no
#     timeout and eighteen minutes of a stranded device.
#   * rustls-tls-webpki-roots rather than native-tls, so there is no OpenSSL
#     to cross-compile and no system certificate store to find on a FireOS 5
#     image that does not have one where anything expects it.
#   * with-libmdns, which is how the speaker APPEARS IN THE APP. Pure Rust,
#     needing nothing from the system — unlike with-avahi (a D-Bus daemon
#     Android does not have) and with-dns-sd (Apple's Bonjour).
#
# ⚠ with-libmdns is one of librespot's OWN defaults, and leaving it off this
# list is how a binary reaches a device unable to advertise itself. That
# shipped: measured 2026-09-10, librespot running healthily on a Dot with
# spotifyEnabled on, and the Echo simply never in the Spotify app — nothing
# logged anywhere, because from librespot's side nothing is wrong. Toggling
# the setting could not fix it either; there is no announcement to resend.
# The comment above reasoned only about the AUDIO backend and never mentioned
# discovery, which is the whole of how it was missed.

# Which of upstream's defaults does this build drop, and did we mean to?
#
# --no-default-features is a blunt instrument: it removes EVERYTHING in
# `default`, including features that have nothing to do with the reason it was
# reached for. Reading the list off the pinned tag and diffing it against what
# we enable and what we deliberately drop turns that silence into a refusal.
#
# Before the build rather than inside it: this costs one HTTP request and
# fails in a second, where the same check after cargo would cost the whole
# cross-compile to tell you the same thing.

# getifaddrs() comes from OUR shim, and the reason is the platform rather than
# librespot. bionic declares getifaddrs __INTRODUCED_IN(24) and FireOS 5 is
# API 22, so `with-libmdns` pulls in if_addrs and the link ends in
#
#   undefined reference to 'getifaddrs'
#   undefined reference to 'freeifaddrs'
#
# device/shairport/compat/android_ifaddrs.c already answers exactly that, over
# netlink, written for shairport-sync's mDNS — and it is self-contained, so it
# links here unchanged. Kept in the shairport directory rather than moved to a
# shared one: it is exercised by that build every time, and relocating a file
# two cross-compiles depend on buys tidiness at the price of the build that
# currently works.
#
# The consequence worth knowing: ANYTHING doing mDNS on this platform hits
# this, because enumerating interfaces is how a responder finds an address to
# advertise. It is not a librespot problem and the next one will not be either.
