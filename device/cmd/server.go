// Two facts about this SoC make these worth reporting, and they are related.
//
// The MT8163 is a QUAD-core Cortex-A53, but MediaTek's hotplug strategy parks
// cores that are not needed: /sys/devices/system/cpu/online is usually just
// "0". A second core comes online only after utilisation holds above
// /proc/hps/up_threshold (80%) for up_times (2) samples. So a device sitting
// at 54% is not near a ceiling — it is comfortably inside one core's budget
// with three more parked.
//
// That directly undermines cpuPct, which is derived from the aggregate
// /proc/stat line and is therefore a share of ONLINE capacity: the same
// absolute work halves its reported percentage the moment a second core
// appears. Reporting coresOnline alongside it is what makes the number
// interpretable rather than merely available.
//
// Thermals matter for the opposite reason — to show there is nothing to worry
// about, or to show when there is. thermalCoreLimit is the sharpest indicator
// this SoC offers: it is how many cores the thermal governor will currently
// permit, so anything below 4 means throttling has begun, which shows up as
// capacity loss long before a temperature reading looks alarming.

// /proc/hps/up_threshold (80%) for up_times (2) samples. That is a sensible
// default for an idle appliance and a poor one for this workload: the mic
// pipeline has a hard 160ms deadline (the ALSA ring's whole depth) and now
// shares a core with wake word inference that runs in ~31ms bursts. Time-
// slicing those on one core works — measured, zero stalls — but it works with
// no margin for a coincidence, and it depends on hotplug reacting in time to a
// burst that has already started.
//
// A floor of 2 lets the two actually run in parallel, and leaves up_threshold
// to scale to 3 and 4 exactly as before. The cost is one A53 core out of idle,
// which on a mains-powered device sitting at 33C is not a real cost: measured
// +0.3C at the PMIC and no change at the CPU zone.

// startNetworkRepair keeps the two pieces of network state Android takes back
// from us, and both were found the same afternoon (2026-09-12) on one device
// that was announcing services nobody could reach.
//
// **The firewall rules do not survive.** The firmware wrote them at startup
// and said so in its log; thirty-nine minutes later the INPUT chain held
// nineteen rules, all Amazon's, none ours, with `policy DROP` counting 137
// packets. netd rebuilds the filter table on network events and keeps only
// what it wrote. `applyFirewall` runs at startup and on config push, which can
// be hours apart — and in between the device advertises what it cannot serve.
//
// **The mDNS multicast membership does not survive either**, and that one is
// worse because nothing about it looks wrong: librespot and shairport-sync
// keep their sockets bound to 5353 while `/proc/net/igmp` has lost
// 224.0.0.251, so no query ever arrives and both go invisible together. That
// is why a reboot always "fixed" it and why the two endpoints always vanished
// as a pair.
//
// One goroutine and one ticker for both. They are the same kind of fault —
// Android writing state back underneath us, the shape `reconcileJackRouting`
// already exists for — and a second ticker would be a second wake-up on a
// device where the mic pipeline has a 160ms deadline.
//
// Neither repair is gated on the base OS. The firewall question is about the
// TABLE rather than about which userspace booted, and the membership question
// is about the KERNEL; emOS answers both the same way, and a device that one
// day loses a membership under emOS is repaired without anybody remembering
