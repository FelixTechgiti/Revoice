# A file rather than a `bash -c` string, unlike the classic recipe. That one
# carries a warning in three places that an apostrophe in a comment ends the
# single-quoted string and breaks the build — a trap that has nothing to teach
# and costs a cycle every time somebody forgets. This script is mounted and
# run, so it can be read, linted and quoted normally.
#
# Everything it fetches is pinned. Where the classic recipe pins a tarball by
# sha256 it is repeated verbatim here; where it cannot, the pin is a git tag,
# which is what the classic recipe already does for mbedtls and libconfig.
#
# NOTHING HERE HAS EVER BEEN RUN. The classic recipe needed seven corrections
# the first time it was executed, and there is no reason to expect better of a
# larger one. What it encodes is the decisions and the traps that were read off
# the sources rather than guessed — see ../README.md.

# which needs hardware timestamping: nqptp's own README says it "does not take
# advantage of hardware timestamping", which is the correction at the centre
# of #79.
#
# The shims are injected with -include, so no upstream source is patched.
#
# BOTH headers, and the second one was added after a measurement rather than
# from reading. android_shm.h used to say cancellation was deliberately kept
# out of nqptp's build because it is "a daemon that does not use threads" —
# and nqptp's own debug.c calls pthread_setcancelstate four times, around the
# critical section of every log line. bionic has no cancellation at any API
# level, so the build failed with `use of undeclared identifier
# PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE` (measured in CI, 2026-09-15).
#
# Only the DECLARATIONS were missing: libemcompat.a already carries
# android_compat.o and nqptp already links it, so this adds no code to the
# binary that was not being linked in anyway. It is the real deferred-
# cancellation shim rather than a no-op stub, which matters even though nqptp
# is unlikely to cancel anything: a stub would be a second, weaker
# implementation of something already implemented correctly twenty lines away.
