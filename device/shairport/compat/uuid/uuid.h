/*
 * uuid/uuid.h — the three pieces of libuuid that shairport-sync uses, for a
 * platform that has no libuuid.
 *
 * bionic ships none, and util-linux — where libuuid actually lives — is a
 * large autotools tree with its own Android quirks. shairport-sync uses
 * exactly `uuid_t`, `uuid_generate_random` and `uuid_unparse_lower`, at one
 * site (shairport.c:556), to mint the AirPlay `pi` identifier. Cross-building
 * util-linux for that is the wrong trade; see android_uuid.c.
 *
 * Named uuid/uuid.h so `#include <uuid/uuid.h>` resolves against -I/compat and
 * no upstream source is patched — the same rule the rest of compat/ follows.
