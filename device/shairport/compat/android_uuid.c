/*
 * android_uuid.c — uuid_generate{,_random} / uuid_unparse_lower for bionic.
 *
 * # Why this is implemented rather than cross-built
 *
 * libuuid lives in util-linux. shairport-sync uses three things from it —
 * `uuid_t`, `uuid_generate_random`, `uuid_unparse_lower` — at ONE site, to
 * mint the AirPlay `pi` identifier that goes in the `_airplay._tcp` TXT
 * records. Cross-compiling util-linux for Android to get them means a large
 * autotools tree with a history of needing Android-specific patches, in
 * exchange for forty lines of RFC 4122 §4.4.
 *
 * The precedent is in this directory: android_ifaddrs.c implements getifaddrs
 * over netlink rather than dragging in a library, for the same reason. The
 * project's rule about not substituting a HOST library still holds and is not
 * in tension with this — that rule is about a library built for the wrong
 * platform silently answering questions about FireOS 5. This is built for the
 * target like everything else here.
 *
 * # Entropy
 *
 * `getrandom(2)` is __INTRODUCED_IN(28) and this builds at 22, so the source
 * is /dev/urandom — which on Android is present, seeded by the kernel before
 * userspace starts, and is what libuuid itself reads.
 *
 * A failure to read it cannot be reported: libuuid's signature returns void
 * and the caller has nowhere to put an error. So it is answered with a
 * WEAKER source and one line on stderr, never with a constant. The difference
 * matters more than it looks: two Echos that mint the same `pi` are two
 * AirPlay devices claiming one identity, which presents as a speaker that
 * appears and disappears from the picker rather than as anything to do with
 * randomness.

 * can. A symbol missing from an archive fails the BUILD over a function that
