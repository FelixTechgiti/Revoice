/*
 * android_shm.c — POSIX shared memory objects, for a libc that has none
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * bionic has no `shm_open` and no `shm_unlink`, at any API level. They are
 * the ONLY interface between nqptp and shairport-sync: nqptp writes the
 * master clock into a `struct shm_structure` and shairport reads it, and
 * that is the whole of the AirPlay 2 clock path (#79).
 *
 * Everything else in that path bionic already has — `ftruncate`, `mmap`,
 * `munmap`, `MAP_SHARED`. **There is no process-shared mutex and no
 * semaphore anywhere in it**: nqptp writes the record twice and the reader
 * `memcmp`s the two copies and retries until they agree (ptp-utilities.c).
 * That is what makes this a shim of ninety lines rather than a port — if
 * either side had reached for `pthread_mutexattr_setpshared` the answer
 * would be different, and it is worth re-checking that on an nqptp bump
 * rather than assuming.
 *
 * So a POSIX shared memory object is a file that both processes mmap, and
 * that is *literally* what glibc does: `shm_open` opens a path under
 * /dev/shm. Android has no /dev/shm, so this picks the directory instead.
 *
 * ── The directory has to be a tmpfs, and this checks ──────────────────────
 *
 * nqptp rewrites the struct at PTP rate. A MAP_SHARED mapping of a file on
 * **flash** has its dirty pages written back by the kernel on its own
 * schedule, for ever, for the life of the daemon — so backing this with
 * /data/local/tmp is not a slower version of the right answer, it is
 * continuous writes to the eMMC of a 2015 speaker that has to keep working.
 * Nothing would report it and nothing would fail; the device would simply
 * age.
 *
 * `/dev` is a tmpfs on Android (init mounts it before anything else runs),
 * so `/dev/revoice-shm` is RAM, is root-owned, and is gone on reboot —
 * which is correct for a clock record that means nothing across a boot.
 *
 * It is checked rather than assumed: `statfs` reports a RAM-backed filesystem
 * — TMPFS_MAGIC under Android, RAMFS_MAGIC under emOS, whose kernel has no
 * devtmpfs — or it does not, and anything else gets one loud line on stderr. It
 * does not refuse — an operator pointing REVOICE_SHM_DIR somewhere
 * deliberately is entitled to — but the hazard is stated where somebody
 * reading a log can find it, rather than left to be discovered as wear.
 *
 * ── Name mapping ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * POSIX says a shared memory name should begin with a slash and contain no
 * others; nqptp uses "/nqptp" and builds client names by appending. The
 * leading slashes are stripped and any remaining slash becomes an underscore,
 * so a name can never escape the directory — `shm_open("/../../etc/x")` lands
 * on `<dir>/.._.._etc_x` and not on /etc. That is a security property, not
 * tidiness, because the name reaches here from a config file.
 *
 * ── What is NOT implemented, deliberately ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No `shm_open` on a name of "" or "/" (EINVAL, as POSIX requires), and no
 * emulation of the O_EXCL-across-a-reboot semantics glibc gets from /dev/shm
 * persisting: the directory is tmpfs, so a reboot clears it, which is what
 * both programs want anyway.
 *
 * This file is compiled on the host by shmcheck.c, which #includes it whole
 * and drives these functions — the emos/init/pwcheck.c pattern, for the same
 * reason: the alternative is a shim nobody can run until it is on a device,
 * and the device is the one place a mistake here is expensive.
