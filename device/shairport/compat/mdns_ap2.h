 * mdns_ap2.h — the part of the AirPlay 2 mDNS advertisement that can be
 * decided without a network.
 *
 * The backend itself (mdns_tinysvcmdns.c, which we replace wholesale) is
 * sockets and threads and cannot run in CI. Everything it has to get RIGHT
 * is here instead: what is currently advertised, how an update merges into
 * it, and the names that come out of it. mdnscheck.c drives these functions
 * on the host, the way shmcheck.c drives the shm shim.
 *
 * Nothing here includes a shairport-sync header, deliberately — that is what
 * keeps the test free of a stub `struct configuration`.
