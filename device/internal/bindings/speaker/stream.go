// come, and which side was late" — the questions we could not answer on
// 2026-07-20 because every available metric measured something else (the
// controller's "Streaming took 0.0s" times a socket write, not delivery).
//
//   - MinDepth: fewest periods left in the buffer at any point mid-stream.
//     The headline margin number. 0 means it starved (an underrun); a stream
//     that only ever reached 2 was one hiccup away.
//   - PrimeWaitMs: first frame arriving → first frame played. Long means the
//     sender could not fill the prime buffer promptly.
//   - RecvSpanMs vs audio duration: delivery slower than realtime is the
//     definitive "the wire could not keep up" signal.
//   - MaxGapMs: the worst single stall in arrivals, which distinguishes a
//     uniformly slow link from a briefly stalled one.

	// 2026-07-08: barge-in cut the LED but the TTS kept talking, and the
	// interrupting turn transcribed the device's own voice). The controller

// # Why this exists
//
// Measured on hardware 2026-09-13. The music plane has four flushers and
// three of them are local producers — librespot and shairport-sync write to a
// pipe and simply stop; nothing sends an EOS, ever. `flush` armed discard for
// them anyway, and `endStream` is the only thing that clears it, so:
//
//	Spotify plays, its track ends -> FlushMusic -> discarding = true
//	AirPlay claims the plane, writes periods -> pump swallows every one
//	-> returns (false, nil), which is SUCCESS
//
// so the claim never lapses, no error is logged, shairport keeps decoding at
// full tilt, the AirPlay volume slider still moves the codec — and there is no
// sound, for as long as librespot's PROCESS lives. That is the shape of it:
// every signal a person would check says healthy, because the one thing that
// went wrong reports itself as a normal outcome.
//
// # And it clears the flag rather than merely not setting it
//
// Deliberate: that repairs a channel already stuck, instead of only sparing
// the next one. A device in this state cannot be talked out of it from the

// on every handover made the speaker declare the music complete each time a
// source changed — which re-arms the prime gate, and the next source waits for
// the buffer to refill before a sound comes out. Measured as "AirPlay after
// Spotify took a while", and as five stream completions in one minute.
//
// What a handover has to undo is exactly one thing: a discard the PREVIOUS
// owner armed, which was armed for its remainder and not for the audio now
