// Package musicplane decides who is filling the device's music stream.
//
// The music plane has exactly ONE producer at a time (audio-states §9,
// invariant 7). Until now that was true by construction — the controller's
// 0x04 frames were the only thing that could reach PumpMusic — and it stops
// being true the moment the device speaks a protocol of its own. Sendspin,
// Spotify Connect and AirPlay are each a second producer of the SAME plane,
// not a plane of their own: they carry the same kind of audio by a different
// route, so the duck, music_flush, the saturating mix, the prime gate and the
// underrun accounting all apply to them unmodified.
//
// Summing two of them is noise. Two music sources are not two instruments;
// they are two songs, and the mixer would hand the speaker their sum.
//
// # Home Assistant wins
//
// A request routed through Home Assistant — "play some jazz" spoken to the
// device, a play_media from an automation, a track started from the HA app —
// beats any local session. It is the direct user request, made to THIS
// device, and it is the one an unanswered request would be most confusing
// about. So the controller can take the plane at any time and never has to
// ask.
//
// That is precedence, not a priority ladder. A local source is not parked
// somewhere below HA waiting its turn: it owns the plane outright whenever HA
// is not asking for it. Among themselves local sources are last-claim-wins,
// which is the same shape the speaker ladder already uses when a user command
// during a turn overrides the controller's auto-resume — the newest direct
// request is the one to honour.
//
// # Leaving is not ignoring
//
// This is the rule that makes the whole thing usable, and it is easy to get
// wrong because the wrong version LOOKS like it works. A source that loses
// the plane must not simply stop writing: a Sendspin server still streaming
// to a client that went quiet keeps filling a buffer nobody hears, the
// group's view of the device stays wrong, and the person who started it sees
// a speaker that joined and plays nothing. Same for AirPlay and for Spotify
// Connect, where the phone keeps showing the Echo as the active device.
//
// So every source registers a Leave callback and this package calls it,
// exactly once, on the transition that takes the plane away. What the source
// does with it is protocol-specific — Sendspin sends `client/goodbye` with a
// reason — but doing nothing is not one of the options.
//
// # No rejoin
//
// When HA-routed music ends the plane is simply free; nothing is handed back.
// A silent rejoin puts audio in the room nobody asked for at that moment, and
// whoever started the group can start it again. The cost of being wrong this
// way is one extra tap, which is the cheap direction.
//
// Untagged and dependency-free so it is testable on the host: this is a state
// machine, and every one of its transitions is a thing that would otherwise
// be discovered on someone's hardware.
