// DefaultIdle is how long a pipe-fed source may go silent before it gives the
// plane back.
//
// Audio arrives from these sources in chunks of roughly 85ms, so this is
// twenty missed reads — far outside ordinary jitter, and short enough that a
// stopped stream is reported promptly. The controller smooths what is left:
// its own hold-off (audioHoldoffMs, 5s) is what keeps a gap between tracks
// from switching somebody's amplifier, so this value does not have to.
const DefaultIdle = 2 * time.Second

// IdleClaim owns the plane only while audio is actually flowing.
//
// It exists because the two pipe-fed endpoints — librespot and shairport-sync
// — are DAEMONS. They run continuously so the device stays in the Spotify and
// AirPlay pickers, and when the phone disconnects they simply stop writing to
// their pipe: the process does not exit, the read blocks, and a plane released
// on process exit is released when the device reboots.
//
// Nothing depended on that until Home Assistant did. The arbiter was only ever
// asked "may I write", and a stale owner answers that correctly — the
// controller preempts a local source at will, so HA-routed music was never
// blocked by it. What a stale owner cannot answer correctly is "is this Echo
// making a sound", which is the question behind the Audio entity, and it
// answered `airplay` for minutes after the session was disconnected.
//
// So the claim expires. Feed is called with every chunk of audio and holds it
// open; silence lets it lapse, and the next chunk claims again.
// Plane is one source's view of the arbiter, as the producer packages already
// declare it for themselves (airplay.PlaneOwner, spotify.PlaneOwner). Taken as
// an interface so those packages keep their own fake in tests, and so this
// works with a Scoped without either side knowing about the other's shape.
