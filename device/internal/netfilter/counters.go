// Reading the chain's own packet counters, and why that is the right
// instrument for "is anything arriving".
//
// # The measurement this replaces
//
// `internal/mcast` used to answer "can this device hear the LAN" by SENDING an
// mDNS query from an ephemeral port with the unicast-response bit set and
// counting who answered. On this platform that measures the firewall rather
// than the network, and it measured it wrong: the replies come from foreign
// unicast addresses to a port no rule names, `-m state --state ESTABLISHED`
// does not match them (the outgoing packet went to 224.0.0.251, the reply comes
// from 192.168.178.x — two different flows to conntrack), and FireOS's
// `-P INPUT DROP` takes them. So the probe reported "this device hears nobody"
// on a device whose own 5353 rule had accepted **93,704 packets**, measured
// 2026-09-12 on hardware while that warning was in the log.
//
// The counter has none of that failure mode, because it IS the firewall: a rule
// that accepted a packet counted it. It also costs one exec and puts nothing on
// anybody's network, where the probe asked every host on the link to answer.
//
// # The one way a counter lies, and it is handled
//
// Counters are per-RULE and reset when the rule is re-inserted — which
// `Reconcile` and every config push do, since this package deletes and
// re-inserts rather than trusting `-C`. A count LOWER than the last one is
// therefore "the rule was replaced", never "no traffic", and the caller has to
// re-baseline rather than read it as silence.

// CountInput returns the INPUT chain with packet counters, as
// `iptables -L INPUT -v -x -n` prints it.
//
// `-n` matters: without it iptables resolves every address through DNS, which
// on a device whose fault may BE the network is a diagnostic that hangs.

// repair, and until it does, half the traffic would be invisible.
//

// so the fixed part is read by index and the port out of the tail, the same
// split `Missing` uses and for the same reason: iptables rewrites what it was
// given, and only the fields survive that.
