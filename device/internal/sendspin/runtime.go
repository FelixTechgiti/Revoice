// Turning scheduled chunks into sound.
//
// The device's music plane is a FIFO with a prime gate: periods go in, the
// ALSA loop takes them at the hardware's own rate, and PumpMusic blocks once
// the buffer is full — so the feed is rate-limited to playback for free and
// nothing here has to pace it. What this has to do instead is get the audio
// to come out at the moment the server named, and keep it there.
//
// Alignment is by SILENCE at the start and by sample-level correction
// afterwards, and both halves are needed:
//
//   - At the start nothing controls when the prime gate releases, so the
//     first real sample would play at whatever moment the buffer happened to
//     fill. Padding with silence moves it: the plane plays what it is given
//     in order, so N frames of silence in front of the audio delays it by
//     exactly N frames.
//   - Afterwards the hardware runs at its own rate, and `delay` (appl_ptr −
//     hw_ptr) is what makes that visible. It grows when we push faster than
//     the hardware consumes, which is exactly the drift signal, and it is a
//     real DMA position rather than our own bookkeeping.
//
// Everything reaches the speaker through a MusicSink, so the whole runtime is
// testable on the host — the real sink is behind a cgo build tag and a
// scheduler that can only be exercised on hardware is one that gets exercised
// by listening.

// MusicSink is the device's music plane, as much of it as this needs.
