// Package logrelay forwards a SELECTION of the firmware's own log to the
// controller, so a fault on the device can be read from somewhere other than
// the device.
//
// # Why
//
// The firmware logs to stdout, which start_server.sh puts in /tmp/server.log —
// RAM-backed, on a box with no remote access of its own. The only lines that
// ever reached the controller were the `[mem]` heap summaries. So
// `[airplay] shairport-sync exited: exit status 1`, repeating every minute for
// two hours, was visible to nobody but somebody willing to open a root shell
// on their own hardware. That is what made 2026-09-10 cost five shell sessions
// and two wrong diagnoses; see the endpoint-orphan section in device/CLAUDE.md.
//
// # Why it is a SELECTION, and tightly bounded
//
// The control plane is the LIVENESS channel: RTT is measured on it, the
// keepalive pong rides it, and `writeJSON` serialises everything through one
// mutex on one TCP stream. Putting bulk traffic there is exactly #404, where
// BLE advertisements on this socket produced 3615 idle RTT excursions in 24h
// against a neighbour's 2. A log relay that forwarded freely would rebuild
// that fault with a different payload.
//
// So: only lines that would make somebody act, never more than `maxPerWindow`
// of them per window, and the count of what was dropped rides the next one
// through. Everything still goes to stdout unchanged — this ADDS a copy for a
// few lines, it does not move the log.
