// librespot's player events, and why the device needs them.
//
// # The fault they exist for
//
// **Pausing Spotify left the Echo playing for another six to seven seconds**,
// measured by its owner on 2026-09-12 and reproduced by arithmetic: the music
// plane holds `audioChanDepth` (128) periods of `periodSize` (2048) frames at
// 48kHz, which is 5.46 seconds, and librespot is paced by the pipe filling
// up — so it keeps that buffer FULL rather than merely primed. Add the Linux
// pipe between us and librespot's own buffer and the number lands where it was
// heard.
//
// Nothing flushed it. librespot simply stops writing on a pause, and whatever
// is already queued plays out.
//
// **The asymmetry is the proof**: starting takes 1-2 seconds, because
// `MusicPrimeFor(local)` releases the stream after four periods (171ms).
// Stopping takes six, because that is how much had accumulated behind it. A
// buffer that is cheap to fill and expensive to drain reads as latency in one
// direction only, which is exactly what was reported.
//
// # Why a FIFO and a shell script
//
// `--onevent` is the only channel librespot offers, and `run_program` splits
// the argument on whitespace and calls `Command::new(argv[0])` — there is no
// shell, so the value has to name a program. `/system/bin/sh <script>` is that
// program, and the script is written by us next to the endpoint's other state.
//
// # The read end is opened O_RDWR, and that is not an accident
//
// `internal/airplay`'s metadata reader opens its FIFO `O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK`
// and reopens on EOF, which is right there: shairport-sync opens the write end
// itself and holds it.
//
// Here the writer is a SHELL PROCESS THAT LIBRESPOT SPAWNS PER EVENT, and
// opening a FIFO for writing blocks until a reader exists. So a moment with no
// reader does not lose one line — it strands a process, and librespot spawns
// another on the next event. Holding the read end O_RDWR means the kernel
// always sees a reader: writers never block, and the read side never sees the
// EOF that the reopen loop exists to handle. One flag removes both problems.
//
// It is still gated at the call site — `--onevent` is passed only when
// something is listening — for the same reason AirPlay's metadata block is.
// The flag is the belt; the gate is the braces.

// EventPipe and EventScript live beside the endpoint's other state, under the
// directory the rename moved (see internal/devicepaths).

	HasVol bool
}

// EndsPlayback reports whether this event means the source has stopped
// producing audio and whatever is buffered is now stale.
//
// `end_of_track` is deliberately NOT in the list. It fires at every track
// boundary in normal playback, and flushing there would cut the tail of every
// song to start the next one — turning a latency fix into a gap.
//
// `session_disconnected` is: the phone has gone, so nothing more is coming and
// what is queued belongs to a session that no longer exists.

// eventScript is what librespot runs. One line per event, and the volume only
// when there is one — `${VOLUME:-}` rather than `$VOLUME` so an event without
// it writes an empty field instead of the shell complaining under `set -u`.
//
// `>>` rather than `>`: two events can overlap, and truncating a FIFO is
// meaningless anyway.
//
// # `echo`, not `printf`, and that is the whole of why this never worked
//
// The first version used `printf '%s %s\n'`, which is correct everywhere the
// author had ever run a shell and wrong here. **FireOS's `/system/bin/sh` is
// mksh, which has no `printf` builtin, and `/system/bin/printf` does not
// exist** — measured on hardware 2026-09-13:
//
//	/system/bin/sh -c 'printf "%s" A'  ->  printf: not found, exit 127
//
// So every event since this shipped ended as `On event program … returned
// exit code 127` in librespot's log, at a WARN level nothing forwarded, and
// the FIFO never saw a byte. Two features were dead behind it and both were
// reported as fixed: the Spotify slider moving this device, and the music
// flush that stops a pause taking the buffer's length to fall silent.
//
// **The rule is the platform, not the command.** This script runs under mksh
// with `/system/bin` on PATH and no coreutils — so it may use shell builtins
// and nothing else. `echo` is one; `printf`, `cat`, `date` and `tr` are not.
// Pinned by test, because the failure is silent at every layer: the script
// exits non-zero, librespot logs a warning, and the firmware simply never
// hears an event it has no reason to expect.
