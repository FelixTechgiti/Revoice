// The script shipped using `printf`, which is correct on every ordinary shell

// builtin, and /system/bin/printf does not exist. Measured on hardware
// 2026-09-13 — `printf: not found`, exit 127 — after which every event since
// the feature shipped had ended as `On event program … returned exit code
// 127` in librespot's log, and the FIFO had never seen a byte.
//
// Two features were dead behind it and both had been reported as working: the
// Spotify slider moving this device, and the music flush that stops a pause
// taking the buffer's length to fall silent.
//
// So the assertion is not "uses echo". It is "uses nothing this shell has to
// go and find", because the next person reaching for `date`, `cat` or `tr`
// makes exactly the same mistake with a different word.
