// Package spotify runs a Spotify Connect endpoint on the device itself.
//
// The Echo appears in the Spotify app as a speaker and plays from it directly,
// with no Home Assistant and no controller in the audio path. That is the
// point: it keeps playing through a controller restart, and it is what makes
// the device useful to somebody who is not standing in front of a voice
// assistant.
//
// # It is a producer of the existing music plane
//
// Like Sendspin, and for the same reasons: the audio is the same KIND of
// audio, so the duck, the saturating mix, the prime gate and the underrun
// accounting all apply unmodified. No new frame type, no new mixer input, no
// new row in the ownership ladder. Home Assistant still wins, and the
// arbiter in internal/musicplane still decides.
//
// # librespot runs as a subprocess, and that is a deliberate choice
//
// It is Rust, and this is a Go program. The alternative — go-librespot — was
// looked at and is worse on every axis that matters here: it requires Go
// 1.25, above the pinned compiler this firmware is built with, and it needs
// cgo against libogg, libvorbis, flac and mpg123, which is four native
// libraries to cross-compile for Android/bionic instead of none. librespot
// with rustls needs no system libraries at all.
//
// The subprocess boundary also buys isolation worth having on a device with
// 512MB shared with Android: a Spotify client that leaks or crashes takes
// nothing with it, and the supervisor restarts it.
//
// # The pipe backend, at 44.1kHz — and a resampler after it
//
// `--backend pipe --format S16` gives raw stereo 16-bit PCM on stdout. It
// gives it at 44,100 frames a second and there is no way to ask for anything
// else: no released librespot has a `--sample-rate` option, and neither does
// `dev`. This was designed the other way round first, on the assumption that
// librespot could resample for us — it cannot, and passing the flag is not a
// silent fallback, it makes librespot refuse to start.
//
// So the conversion happens here, through internal/resample, the same path
// AirPlay uses. It costs 4-8% of one A53 core while Spotify is playing.
//
// **The pipe backend is famously "too fast", and here that is the feature.**
// librespot writes as fast as the pipe accepts, with no pacing of its own —
// which is a problem when the far end is a file and a virtue when it is a
// buffer that blocks. PumpMusic blocks once the music plane is full, the
// pipe backpressures, and librespot is paced to playback for free. Nothing
// in this package rate-limits anything, deliberately.
//
// # Nothing here is scheduled
//
// Unlike Sendspin, Spotify Connect is one device playing one stream: there is
// no group to stay in step with, no server timestamps, and therefore no clock
// filter and no drift correction. The device plays at its own rate because
// its own rate is the only one that matters.

//     merged. The pipe backend emits 44,100 frames a second, so the
//     conversion happens here, through internal/resample, exactly as it does
//     for AirPlay. Passing the flag anyway is not a silent fallback: librespot
//     rejects an unknown option and refuses to start.

//     means a librespot that changes its default does not silently start
//     sending 32-bit floats into a 16-bit mixer.

//     Android and a cache of decoded audio is the fastest way to fill it. The
//     CREDENTIAL cache is separate and is kept — that is what stops the user

//
//	13:11:57 [librespot] Loading <COMEBACCC> with Spotify URI <...>
//	13:11:57 [librespot] ERROR spirc] Invalid state { the provided context has no tracks }
//	13:11:58 [airplay]   ending the session: preempted
//	13:11:58 [music]     plane owner: spotify
//	13:11:58 [airplay]   shairport-sync exited: signal: killed
//	13:12:03 [speaker]   music stream complete — returning to silence
//
// A Spotify DJ context resolved empty (see logfilter.go). librespot played the
// fallback track anyway, which claimed the plane, which evicted a LIVE AirPlay
// session — and eviction kills shairport-sync, so the phone's session is over
// and there is no rejoin. Five seconds later Spotify stopped too. Net result
// of a feature that cannot work: the one that was working is dead as well.
//
// # Why the signal is the log and not a state machine
//
// librespot's stderr is the only place this is knowable. There is no status
// socket, the exit code is 1 for every fault it has, and the audio itself
// carries no hint — the fallback track is ordinary PCM.
//
// # Why clearing it on `Loading` is sufficient, and a timeout is not needed
//
// The flag can only ever withhold an EVICTION, never playback, and every
// track that plays is announced by a `Loading <...>` line BEFORE its first
// sample reaches the pipe. So a real track always clears the flag ahead of
// the claim it needs, and a flag stuck on cannot silence anything. That
// ordering is the whole design and is pinned by a test: in the trace above
// the fallback's own `Loading` arrives BEFORE the error, which is what leaves
// the flag set for the claim that follows.
