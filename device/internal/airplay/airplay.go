// Package airplay runs an AirPlay receiver on the device itself.
//
// A phone, a Mac or an iPad picks the Echo out of its AirPlay list and plays
// to it directly. Like Sendspin and Spotify Connect, it is a producer of the
// EXISTING music plane — same duck, same mixer, same prime gate, same
// arbiter — and shairport-sync runs as a subprocess for the same reasons
// librespot does: it is C, this is Go, and a receiver that crashes on a
// device sharing 512MB with Android should take nothing with it.
//
// # What is actually achievable here, stated plainly
//
// The user asked for AirPlay 2 and that remains the target. This comment used
// to list three things standing between here and there. All three were
// checked against the sources on 2026-09-11 and none of them held (#79); the
// corrections are kept rather than deleted, because a wrong reason not to do
// something is worse than no reason.
//
//   - **"AirPlay 2 needs Avahi, a D-Bus daemon Android does not have."** Not
//     so: configure.ac ties --with-airplay-2 to no mDNS backend at all. What
//     is true is narrower — of the four backends only mdns_avahi.c
//     implements the second service. mdns_tinysvcmdns.c takes ap2name and
//     secondary_txt_records and declares both __attribute__((unused)), and
//     sets no mdns_update, so _airplay._tcp is never advertised. That is
//     ~100 lines in one file, not a port of Avahi.
//   - **"nqptp wants timestamps this kernel cannot provide in hardware."**
//     nqptp's own README: "nqptp does not take advantage of hardware
//     timestamping." It needs UDP 319/320 exclusively and the privilege to
//     bind them; the device is rooted and Android runs no PTP service.
//   - **"The device is under the stated minimum."** The floor was misquoted.
//     It is "a Raspberry Pi 2 or a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, or better" — a
//     quad Cortex-A53 at 1GHz with 512MB. The MT8163 is a quad Cortex-A53 at
//     1.3GHz with 512MB, so the device is at or above it.
//
// What is genuinely in the way: shm_open does not exist in bionic and is the
// nqptp<->shairport clock interface (three call sites, no process-shared
// mutex in it, so a file-backed mmap substitutes faithfully); ffmpeg has to
// be cross-built for armv7a/API 22; five more libraries with it; and 512MB is
// shared with Android, which is the one item that has to be measured rather
// than read.
//
// So the build recipe targets CLASSIC AirPlay first — the sequencing reason,
// not a technical one: the classic binary has not yet been proven to run on a
// Dot, and building AirPlay 2 first means debugging two unknowns at once.
//
// This package does not care which it gets: both speak the same subprocess
// interface — PCM on stdout. The sample-rate difference given here was wrong
// too: AirPlay 2 is NOT 48kHz. Its Buffered Audio is AAC-LC at 44,100 frames
// per second and its Realtime streams are ALAC exactly as in classic, so
// internal/resample stays in the path either way. Nothing here has to change
// when the AirPlay 2 build lands.
