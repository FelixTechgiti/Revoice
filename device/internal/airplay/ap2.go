// on the device, beside shairport-sync.
//
// It is a separate program rather than a thread because that is what upstream
// ships: it needs UDP 319 and 320 to ITSELF — shairport-sync cannot hold them
// and neither can anything else — and it publishes the clock through a shared
// memory object that shairport reads. On bionic that object is a file under a
// tmpfs; see device/shairport/compat/android_shm.c.

// ShmDirEnv and its default have to agree between the two processes, or each
// maps a different file and shairport reads a record that never changes —
// which presents as AirPlay 2 audio that will not synchronise rather than as
// anything to do with memory. The firmware passes the value explicitly to BOTH
// rather than letting them both fall back to the same default, so a change to
// one cannot silently desync them.
