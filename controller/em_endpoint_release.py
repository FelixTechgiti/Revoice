em_endpoint_release.py — picking the endpoint binaries out of a GitHub release
==============================================================================

The Spotify and AirPlay binaries were built somewhere and uploaded by hand,
once per controller, which is the friction OTA exists to remove. `endpoints-v*`
releases publish them (`.github/workflows/endpoint-release.yml`) and this
module is the pure half of collecting one: which release, which assets, and
whether the store already holds what that release published.

**Its own tag namespace, and the selection is deliberately narrow.**
`em_api._fetch_latest_release` selects a tag starting `v` carrying a `server`
asset, so `endpoints-v1.0.0` matches neither test and the firmware OTA poller
can never see one. This selects on the opposite things, and the two share no
cache, for the reason `_fetch_latest_emos_release` is a separate function
rather than a parameter: one cache holding whichever kind was asked for last
is a cache that answers the wrong question half the time.

**Both binaries or neither.** A release carrying one is one the controller
installs happily while reporting the other as "not installed", which from the
dashboard is indistinguishable from a device that never received it. The
release workflow refuses to publish a half release; this refuses to select
one, because a workflow can be edited and a fielded controller cannot.

**The store is only ever overwritten where the controller wrote it.**
Provenance records the tag a fetch came from and the md5 it wrote for each
kind. A stored binary whose md5 no longer matches that record was put there by
a person — the dashboard's upload, a hand build of a patched librespot — and
replacing it with the published one would silently undo the thing they were
testing, on a timer, with nothing said. Absent provenance is the same answer:
we did not write it, so it is not ours to replace.
