"""
em_api.py — Revoice Controller HTTP API + Dashboard
=====================================================

aiohttp web application running in the same asyncio event loop as the
WebSocket controller. Serves:

  /                         — dashboard SPA (static/index.html)
  /setup                    — first-run admin account creation
  /api/auth/*               — login, logout, current user
  /api/devices/*            — fleet management, config, logs, OTA
  /api/releases/*           — GitHub release tracking and deployment
  /api/system/*             — controller status and config
  WS /api/events            — live push: device state, logs, pending
  WS /api/devices/{id}/shell — proxied root shell on device

Path routing is handled by the existing websockets router in
em_controller.py — aiohttp handles /api/* and /, websockets handles
/control, /data, and /shell/{device_id}.

Usage (from em_controller.py main()):
    import em_api
    runner = await em_api.create_runner(devices_ref)
    await runner.setup()
    site = web.TCPSite(runner, host, port + 1)   # or same port via middleware
    await site.start()
    ...
    await runner.cleanup()

The _devices dict reference is passed in so the API can merge live
state with persisted DB state without coupling to a global.

    Scan a compiled Go binary for its embedded Revoice version string.

    Two schemes, because compile.sh changed and this did not:

      20260614-1152-dev     date+suffix — used when the tree is DIRTY, and
                            the only scheme this function knew until now

    Matching only the second is why a clean-tree local build extracted
    nothing, fell back to a `local-<timestamp>` label, and then never matched
    the version the device reported on reboot — so a completely successful
    deploy was announced as "auto-rolled back". A message that says the
    opposite of what happened is worse than a plain failure, because the
    natural response is to distrust the feature.

    BARE `vX.Y.Z` IS DELIBERATELY NOT MATCHED, and that is the whole
    subtlety. A Go binary embeds its dependencies' module versions, so the
    shape is far from unique — measured on the v2.12.0-63-g99628d3 build:
    102 occurrences, 9 distinct, including v0.41.0 (x/sys), v1.5.3
    (gorilla/websocket), v1.0.3 (GoTinyAlsa) and v1.1.41 (miekg/dns). Our own
    version happened to appear first in file order on that build, which is
    luck and not a property to rely on: a dependency string landing earlier
    would silently extract the wrong version and label the deploy with it.

    The `-N-gSHA` suffix makes it unique — exactly one match on the same
    binary — so only the suffixed form is accepted. A build made exactly ON a
    tag has no suffix and extracts nothing, which is correct: that binary
    belongs on the release path, and returning None gets an honest
    `local-<timestamp>` label rather than a confident wrong one.

    Returns None when nothing matches; the caller labels it
    `local-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` and the reconnect check compares against the
    version the device had BEFORE the push rather than against this.

    `printf %s "$__R" | base64 -d | md5sum`. At 64 bytes that works, which is
    why the header read of a reflash always succeeded; at 1MB the base64 is
    1.37MB and an argument that size is past `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` (128KB) for any
    `printf` that is a binary rather than a shell builtin. It fails, md5sum
    weighs an empty pipe, and the caller is told the chunk arrived corrupt —
    which is a wrong answer rather than no answer: the bytes were intact, and
    every reflash refused at offset 0 with nothing wrong with the device
    (measured 2026-09-20 on a live emOS Echo, both attempts identical).

    Two reads of a block device nothing is writing return the same bytes, so
    what the digest still proves is the thing that can actually go wrong on
    this path: that the base64 which arrived here decodes to what the
    partition holds. What it no longer covers is a file changing under us
    between the two reads, which is why this stays what its docstring already
    said it was — a boot-partition reader, not a general file fetch.

    The variable is gone with it: the base64 streams straight out between two
    sentinel lines, so nothing on the device has to hold a megabyte. The
    general rule worth keeping is that a shell VARIABLE is not a way around an
    argument-length limit — it only moves where the limit is met, and `echo`
    being a builtin everywhere while `printf` need not be is what made the two
    halves of one command disagree in silence.

    Heal debloat drift on a device that is already in the field.

    The debloat has two halves and neither had an update path. The boot script
    was installed once by the provisioning wizard, and the pm-hide list was
    applied once at the same time — so a device provisioned before a list grew
    never receives the addition. Found 2026-07-30 when round 2 added
    com.amazon.whad and every existing device needed a manual push.

    Both halves are reconciled here, idempotently, so this is safe to run as
    often as you like:

      * the script by md5 against the canonical payload, replaced by rename so
        the running shell keeps reading the old inode (same reasoning as
        _sync_start_script — it takes effect on the next device reboot);
      * the hide list by asking the device which of those packages are still
        VISIBLE and hiding only those. One `pm list packages` costs about a
        second; `pm hide` is slow enough per call that hiding all 32
        unconditionally would add half a minute for nothing.

    Best-effort throughout: a failure logs and returns, and never blocks the
    firmware update this normally rides along with.

    Note what hiding does NOT do: com.amazon.whad is PERSISTENT, so hiding it
    leaves the running instance alive until the next reboot (am force-stop is a
    no-op on it — measured). That matches the rest of the debloat's semantics
    rather than being a shortcoming of this function, and it is why the log
    line says "next reboot".

    One shell command on the device, run to completion, output returned.

    # This grants nothing new

    `WS /api/devices/{id}/shell` already hands an admin a full interactive
    root shell on the device, and has since the dashboard had a console tab.
    This is the same capability in a shape a program can call: one request,
    one answer, no terminal to drive. The bar is therefore the SAME bar —
    admin — and it must stay there rather than becoming a lesser one on the
    grounds that it looks smaller than a terminal.

    # Why it exists

    Everything about diagnosing a device currently needs a person at a
    keyboard, driving a terminal, copying the output somewhere it can be
    read. That person is a bottleneck on their own hardware: they are the
    only path between what the device knows and anyone who could act on it,
    and they have to be awake. The Echo's own log now survives a power cycle;
    this is what makes the rest of the device answerable the same way.

    # What keeps it accountable

    **Every command is logged with the user who ran it**, at the same place
    and in the same shape as `Shell session opened by <user>` — because the
    owner of a device must be able to read back what was run on it, and an
    interactive session at least announces itself. A scriptable one that did
    not would be the quieter of the two, which is the wrong way round.

    Sequential per device, like every other shell user here: `_shell_run`
    takes the per-device lock, so this cannot interleave with an OTA transfer
    or a dashboard terminal.

    Bring a freshly-connected device's four installed payloads back in line.

    A device arriving is the one moment we know what it has, and until

    early unless the device scored locally and then checked only the SELECTED
    classifier, while `_sync_start_script` and `_sync_debloat` ran ONLY inside
    an OTA or from the Maintenance button. So a device already on the latest
    firmware never received a payload change at all — Office sat without three
    of the four stock classifiers for a fortnight with every panel calling it
    healthy.

    Three rules:

    - **Sequential, never gathered.** All four talk to the same device over
      the same shell plane; running them concurrently contends for one session
      for no gain, since none of them is on the critical path of anything.
    - **One failure must not skip the rest.** They are unrelated payloads
      and a device with a stale debloat list should still get its wake word
      models. Each is best-effort in its own right, and this only stops them
      taking each other down.
    - **Debounced per device** (`RECONCILE_DEBOUNCE_S`), because reconnects are
      routine on this fleet and the payloads are not.

    Runs as a background task off the connect handler: nothing about the

    On connect: make sure a locally-scoring device HAS the model it was told
    to use, and put the controller back in charge if it does not.

    Every other install path runs while the device is connected — the wizard
    over ADB, `_install_then_switch` on a config save, the Updates tab by hand.
    A device that was OFFLINE when its wake word changed has none of them: the
    connect handler pushes the effective config directly, so it is told to use
    a classifier it may never have received. Under `owwOnDevice=on` that is a
    device with no wake word at all — it cannot score, and the controller has
    stood down and no longer triggers on its behalf (#191). Changing the wake
    word, or re-scoping the wakeword section, while a device is unplugged is
    enough to produce it.

    This is `oww_model_ready`'s intended writer. Three rules:

    - **Failure to LOOK is not evidence of absence.** Any error reading the
      device's inventory leaves `oww_model_ready` alone, so a shell plane that
      is not up yet — likely, moments after connect — costs nothing. Only a
      successful listing that does not contain the model stands the device
      down. Absence of evidence, per em_shadow.effective_mode's own docstring.
    - **Degrade first, then repair.** The mode is dropped to off the moment the
      model is known missing, which puts the CONTROLLER back to triggering, so
      the device answers throughout the install rather than only after it. That
      ordering is the opposite of `_install_then_switch`, deliberately: there
      the device is already on a wake word it can hear and must not be
      disturbed, here it is already deaf.
    - **Quiet when there is nothing to do.** Devices on this fleet reconnect
      often, so the ordinary path is one shell round trip and no log line.

    Runs as a background task: it is a shell round trip and possibly a
    multi-megabyte push over a link measured at 5-7% packet loss, and nothing
    about the connect handshake should wait on it.

    the toggle from disabled to usable without waiting for a reconnect.

    **A running endpoint is restarted afterwards unless somebody is

    Replacing the file is a rename over a directory entry, so a running
    process keeps the inode it is executing and carries on with the OLD code

    thing you installed it for still does not work. That reasoning was

    somebody is listening to, to update a file nobody asked to switch to
    yet, is the more surprising behaviour. It is wrong about the common
    case, where the endpoint is idle and doing nothing silently wastes the
    install.

    Telling those apart is the controller's knowledge — no frame of an
    endpoint's audio passes through here, which is why `audio_source` exists

      1. Ask the device about itself — base, rollback image, free space.
      2. Read its own boot image off p10. The kernel and device trees in it
         are the device's and are reused verbatim; nothing else knows them.
      3. Build the new image HERE, with the packer the wizard uses. Doing it
         on the device would mean a second packer in shell, against the one
         whose byte-exactness is tested.
      4. Push it to /data, verified.
      5. Write it, read back exactly as many bytes as were written, compare.
      6. Reboot.

    **If this leaves a bad image, emOS repairs it without us.** init confirms
    a boot only when the network comes up and restores boot-good.img after
    three that were not confirmed. So the worst outcome of a wrong image here
    is an amber ring and the previous emOS, which is the outcome that makes
