"""
Config sections — the unit of fleet-vs-device scoping.

A device used to be all-or-nothing: `use_global_config` was one boolean, so
you either inherited the entire fleet config or overrode every key of it.
That got unwieldy as the config grew — wanting a device-specific ring scene
meant forking its mic gain, wake threshold and EQ too, and they then stopped
tracking fleet changes forever.

Scoping is now per section. A device stores the SET of sections it overrides;
its effective config is the fleet config with the device's own values layered
over it for those sections only. Everything else keeps following the fleet.

This module is the single source of truth for which key belongs to which
section. `controller/static/dashboard.jsx` carries a mirror of SECTIONS for
rendering, and tests/test_config_sections.py fails if the two drift or if any
config key ends up belonging to no section.

# device re-applies it via SeedVolume on the first config push per run. That
# round trip is what makes volume survive a reboot, so the key has to stay —
# but it is not something you set, and it was never meaningfully editable
# (SeedVolume ignores later pushes, so the old dashboard slider did nothing
# until the device restarted and was overwritten by any real volume change).
# Fleet default 85 still does one real job: the starting point for a device
# that has never reported.
# idleRing/idleRingBrightness are the same shape one step further along: the
# ring's resting colour is set from Home Assistant's light entity and written
# back here so it survives a restart, exactly as a volume change is. Not
# fleet-inherited, for the reason volume is not — "every Echo in the house
# turns the same colour when one of them is told to" is not a fleet default,
# it is a bug — and deliberately not on a dashboard Stage: two controls owning
# one value is how they drift.

# an edge case, it is what happens the moment a second device exists. The
# section they live in (`streaming`) is still the right home for the toggles
# beside them: whether an Echo runs Spotify Connect at all is exactly the kind
# of thing a fleet decides together.

# STATE_KEYS are not settings at all — they are hardware state the device

# types, and the dashboard must show them as device-scoped rather than
# silently ignoring a fleet value that was entered in good faith.
