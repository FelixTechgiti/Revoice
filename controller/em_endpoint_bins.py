"""
em_endpoint_bins.py — the Spotify and AirPlay binaries, and getting them onto a device
=====================================================================================

`librespot` (Spotify Connect) and `shairport-sync` (AirPlay) run as
subprocesses of the firmware, and neither is part of it. Both are third-party
programs with no Android build published anywhere, so they are cross-compiled
once from `device/librespot/` and `device/shairport/` and then have to reach
every device — which until this module meant `adb push` over USB, a cable on
the Dot for every install and every update. That is the friction OTA exists to
remove, and #16 is it arriving for the last two payloads that still had it.

**The store is a fleet-level thing, the install is per device.** A binary is
uploaded once into `endpoint_bins/` beside the SQLite DB — inside the data
volume, so it survives an image upgrade the way `oww_models/` does — and is
then pushed to each device from there. Uploading per device would mean sending
the same 20MB up the dashboard once per Dot, and would leave no way to answer
"is this device running the binary I built?", which is the question a fleet
asks after a rebuild.

**Why the ELF header is checked and the version is not.** The single most
likely upload mistake is the host build: `cargo build --release` without the
target, or the x86 shairport-sync that `./configure` produces when it finds
the host compiler — both are plausible files with plausible names that the
device cannot exec. An ARM32 ELF check catches that at the dashboard, where
there is somebody to tell. It cannot go further: these are upstream programs
with no Revoice version string in them, and there is no manifest to compare
against, so `md5` is the only identity either end can agree on.

This module is pure path, planning and header logic — no aiohttp, no db, no
websockets — so what decides to push, and what refuses to, is unit-tested
rather than only exercised against a live device. The transport lives in
em_api.py and is `_stream_file_to_device`, unchanged: it writes to
`{dest}.part` and renames only once the md5 matches, which is exactly the
ordering these two payloads need. A failed install must leave the previous
binary in place, because that binary is what the endpoint falls back to.

    One installable endpoint binary.

    `dest` must match the device's own constant — `spotify.BinaryPath` in
    `device/internal/spotify/spotify.go` and `airplay.BinaryPath` in
    `device/internal/airplay/airplay.go`. There is a test. A disagreement
    here installs a perfectly good binary somewhere the firmware never
    looks, and reports success for it.

    `capability` is what the firmware announces when it can run the endpoint
    at all, and `status_attr` is where the runtime answer lands on the live
    Device. Two gates, never one: the capability says the supervisor exists,
    the status says whether the program is there. Collapsing them tells
    somebody their firmware is too old when a file was simply never pushed.

    `config_key` is the device's own toggle, and it is what the automatic
    install is gated on. Pushing ~9MB to every device in the fleet because a
    release exists would spend a lossy link on a program nobody asked to run;
    turning the toggle on IS the ask, and it is the only signal that carries
    the user's intent for this device rather than for the store.

    `status_sub` is the key INSIDE `status_attr` that answers for this
    file, for a kind that shares another's status object. Sharing the
    attribute outright was wrong in both directions and neither showed up
    until a device had one file and not the other: reading it meant nqptp
    reported as installed on the strength of shairport-sync being there,
    and writing it meant an nqptp install overwrote the receiver's whole
    status — flavour, version and all — with a stat of a different file.
    The device already reports the nested answer (`airplay_status.nqptp`,
    from `describeFlavour`), so nothing new crosses the wire.

    `status_fallback` says that the TOP LEVEL is this kind's answer on
    firmware too old to send the nested block. True for the classic
    receiver, which was the only receiver: older firmware reports one file
    and reports it at the top, so refusing the fallback would show every
    fielded device as "state unknown". False everywhere else, and that
    asymmetry is the whole point — a fallback for a file that was never the
    top level is how the clock daemon came to be reported as installed
    because the receiver was.

    `in_release` says whether an `endpoints-v*` release publishes this kind,
    and it is NOT the same question as whether a device can be given one.
    Conflating them is what a third kind found: `select()` refuses a release
    that carries some of its assets and not others — deliberately, so half a
    publish is never half adopted — so a kind that no release has ever carried
    would make every existing release unusable and silently stop the automatic
    fetch for the two kinds that do ship. Installable and published are
    different facts, and the flag is where they are kept apart. Flip it when a
    release starts carrying the asset.

    Four ways of declining, each a rule from elsewhere in this tree:

      * the toggle is off — the user has not asked for this endpoint HERE.
        The store being full is not an instruction to fill the fleet.
      * the firmware does not announce the capability — a binary with nothing
        to exec it, which is what `refuse_install` already says by hand.
      * the shell said nothing we understand (`status is None`) — failure to
        LOOK is not evidence of absence, and moments after a connect the
        shell plane is very likely not up yet. Pushing on that is a guess,
        and the same rule `reconcile_oww_assets` is built on.
      * the device reports a file of exactly the store's size — the only
        agreement the two ends can reach, since the firmware stats the file
        rather than hashing it. Suggestive and never proof, and the
        alternative is re-pushing every binary on every connect for ever.

    The shell one-liner whose output `parse_stat` reads.

    **busybox first, then plain `wc`** — the same order every other shell
    payload in this controller uses, and for the same reason: Magisk provides
    busybox, and it is the stock toolbox that might not answer. Measured on
    the fleet 2026-09-06: a bare `wc -c` produced nothing on a live device, so
    both endpoint installs reported `ok` with no size at all.

    The fallback did the right thing — the executable bit is the gate and the
    size is presentation — but the size is the field that says whether the
    file which landed is the one you built, which is the whole question after
    pushing 9MB over a shell.

    The size is still allowed to fail: both spellings are tried, neither is
    required, and `parse_stat` keeps `ok` when the field comes back empty. A
    device with no working `wc` must not read as a failed install.

    None when the marker is absent — the shell said nothing we understand,
    which is a link problem and must not be recorded as "not installed". An
    install that verified its own md5 and then recorded the file as missing
    would undo a successful install in the dashboard.

    The LAST marker line wins. The shell plane is a long-lived session
    rather than a fresh process per command, so a previous command's output
    can still be in the buffer when this one is read; taking the first match
    would answer with whatever was there before. The echoed command line
    itself is not a hazard — it starts with `if`, not with the marker.
