"""
Home Assistant can close this microphone and cannot open it.

Unmuting is a PHYSICAL act. Someone muted this device by pressing the button
on it, and the red LED under that button is a promise; handing the
microphone back over the network would let a mistaken automation, a shared
Home Assistant login or a compromised controller break that promise while
the LED still makes it, in a room where nobody touched anything.

The rule is enforced at three levels, and the guards below check each,
because any one of them alone would be a runtime check somebody can drop:

  1. The control message carries NO boolean. There is nothing on the wire
     that could ask for an unmute, so the refusal cannot be forgotten.
  2. The device's MuteOnly never toggles (device-side Go test).
  3. The controller offers no unmute closure, and the switch handler refuses
     `state=False` rather than folding it.

em_esphome and em_controller are not importable here, so these are shape
guards on the shipped source — the same approach the rest of this suite
takes for those two modules.
