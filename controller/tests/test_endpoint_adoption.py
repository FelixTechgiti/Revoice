"""
Recognising a stored binary as a published build, without provenance.

The provenance rule — never overwrite what the controller cannot prove it
wrote — is right, and it protects a patched build somebody is testing. But it
cannot tell that apart from a file downloaded off the releases page and
uploaded through the dashboard: the record that would distinguish them is the
record that is missing. So every store filled before provenance existed was
frozen for ever, and the published build never arrived.

A byte-for-byte match against something a release published settles it. Not a
heuristic — identical bytes ARE that build. GitHub reports each asset's
sha256 as its `digest`, so the comparison costs no download.

The store below is the LIVE one from the fleet on 2026-09-11, and it is the
reason this exists: a hand-built librespot beside a shairport-sync that is
byte-identical to endpoints-v1.0.0's.
