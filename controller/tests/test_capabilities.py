"""
Device/controller compatibility is negotiated by CAPABILITY, not version.

The two halves of this project ship on independent version schemes (device
`v*`, controller `controller-v*`), so any given moment can pair new firmware
with an old controller or the reverse. Version comparison would mean encoding
release history into the controller and getting it wrong the first time
someone runs a dev build; a capability is the device stating what it
implements.

That only works if both sides spell the capability identically. A typo makes
the feature permanently unavailable and looks exactly like a device that does
not support it — silent, and the sort of thing you debug from the wrong end.
So the strings are asserted to match across the two languages, the same way
CONFIG_SECTIONS is mirrored between Python and dashboard.jsx.
