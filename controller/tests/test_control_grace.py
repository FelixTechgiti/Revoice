#315: a control-plane drop used to tear down a device's services
immediately — HA entities deregistered, BLE proxy dropped, media session
killed — and rebuilt all of it when the device returned seconds later.
The data plane has had DATA_RECONNECT_GRACE_S for exactly this reason;
the control plane never got the equivalent.

em_controller is deliberately not importable here (see conftest); these
are shape guards on the shipped source.
