"""
Nothing in this repository may look like an add-on config unless it is one.

Home Assistant's Supervisor scans an add-on repository with `**/config.*` and
parses every hit as an add-on configuration. A file that merely SHARES that
name is read, fails, and lands in every user's Supervisor log:

    ERROR [supervisor.utils.yaml] Can't read YAML file
      /data/apps/git/46aaf331/oww_forge/config.template.yml
      - while scanning for the next token, line 17, column 1
    WARNING [supervisor.store.data] Can't read ... from repository 46aaf331

`oww_forge/config.template.yml` was exactly that: a TRAINING config template
whose line 17 is the placeholder `@PHRASES@`, which is not YAML and is not
meant to be. It was reported on every store scan for days, on this fork and
upstream alike, while the store sat a release behind what the default branch
said.

The glob is Supervisor's and cannot be changed from here, so the rule is
ours: a file matching `config.*` in this repository is an add-on config and
parses, or it is named something else.
