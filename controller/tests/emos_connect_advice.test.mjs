//     node controller/tests/emos_connect_advice.test.mjs
//
// Same source-extraction approach as web_usb_blocked.test.mjs: the function is
// lifted out of dashboard.jsx rather than imported, because the dashboard
// compiles to a single classic script. If it is renamed or moved, the lift
// fails loudly and this file must follow.
//
// **What matters here is the ADVICE, not the detection** — the same thing
// web_usb_blocked.test.mjs says about itself, and for a sharper reason.
// `No device selected.` covers two situations that look identical:
//
//   - a dismissed picker, a Dot that is off, a charge-only cable — retrying is
//     the right response;
//   - a Dot ALREADY RUNNING emOS, where retrying can never work, because emOS
//     has no adbd and never will.
//
// Nothing in the page can tell them apart, so the only thing standing between
// somebody and a dead end is the wording. Leaving out `/init recovery` is what
// #134 was filed for: the route has existed since emOS 0.4 and appeared in no
// dialog.
//
// **Every check runs in BOTH languages**, because the advice moved into
// `strings.js`. A route that survives only in English is not a route for
// whoever is reading the German build — and that is the person most likely to
// be holding the device.
