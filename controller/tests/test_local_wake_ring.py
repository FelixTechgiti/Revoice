#263: the device lights the listening ring locally at its own wake crossing.

The crossing used to travel to the controller and wait for leds_listening
to come back — measured at +522ms before the ring moved, on a link whose
control-plane tail reaches 2s (#139). The fix has two halves that must both
exist: the controller hands the device its current listening animation in
the config push, and the device draws it before reporting the crossing.
