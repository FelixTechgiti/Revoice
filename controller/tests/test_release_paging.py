"""
The releases list is read a page at a time, and the page size decides which
tag NAMESPACES are visible at all.

Three selectors read one list — firmware `v*`, `emos-v*`, `endpoints-v*` —
and with `per_page=10` the release cadence of one silently hid another.
Measured on the live controller 2026-09-11: ten firmware releases had
accumulated in front of `endpoints-v1.1.0`, so `/api/endpoint_binaries`
answered `"release": null` about a two-day-old release carrying both assets.
Nothing failed and nothing logged; the only symptom was a button that never
appeared and an AirPlay feature that could not work.

These are structural assertions on em_api's source rather than behaviour
tests, for the reason test_deploy.py's are: the thing that broke is a
constant and a URL, and the failure mode is silence.
